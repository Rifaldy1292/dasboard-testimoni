# TailAdmin Vue - Free Vue.js Tailwind CSS Admin Dashboard Template
TailAdmin Vue is a free, open-source admin dashboard template **built on Vue.js**, popular and progressive JavaScript framework, and **Tailwind CSS**. This **powerful combination** provides developers with an extensive library of essential components, elements, and pages to launch a comprehensive and data-centric back-end, dashboard, or admin panel solution for any Vue.js based web projects. 

With TailAdmin Vue, you can leverage Vue.js features such as declarative rendering, component-based architecture, Vue Router for routing, and Vuex for state management. It also harnesses the power of Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with its low-level utility classes and responsive design capabilities.

The template offers a **diverse set of dashboard UI components**, elements, and pages, including forms, tables, charts, maps, and pre-built pages, which are critical for creating a high-quality and complete admin panel or dashboard. It also supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Single-Page Applications (SPA) for improved performance and user experience. 

Whether youâ€™re developing a complex web application or a simple website, TailAdmin Vue provides a robust and flexible foundation to streamline your workflow and enhance your project's functionality.
